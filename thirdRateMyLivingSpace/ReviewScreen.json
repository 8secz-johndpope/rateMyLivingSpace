This living space grants the tenant the right to be loud and obnoxious constantly. It is a great place to live if you are loud. But if you are quiet, then live somehwere else. The management is also terrible at responding to problems","ReviewStars": 3.9,"Latitude":37.7183,"Longitude":-122.4810,"RoomRate":"$2,857" },
